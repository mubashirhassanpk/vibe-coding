# Vibe Coding Prompts

Design a futuristic, visually stunning SaaS analytics dashboard — a Baremetrics-style metrics tool built for modern founders and teams. It should display key subscription metrics (MRR, churn, LTV, ARPU, growth rate, active users) with sleek, real-time visualizations and fluid transitions between views.
The UI should feel like a blend of Baremetrics and Apple Vision Pro — ultra-polished, lightweight, and high-tech. Use a dark-mode base (# 0E1117) with luminous neon accents (electric blue, violet, mint green) and soft glassmorphism effects on panels. All charts should animate on load — bar charts rising fluidly, pie charts rotating into place, and line graphs pulsing gently as they stream live data.
Incorporate smooth hover and tap interactions: tiles expand, tooltips fade in, and section switches slide with spring-like animations. The sidebar should be minimal but elegant — just icons with glowing states, and optional labels on hover.
Typography should use a modern sans-serif like Satoshi, Geist, or Space Grotesk, with bold 28–32px headers and subtle glowing sublabels. Use soft shadows, rounded cards, and smart use of negative space to keep the layout breathable.
Key sections: Overview (MRR, Users, Churn) Revenue Breakdown (Plans, Locations, Sources) Customer Insights (Cohorts, LTV, Retention) Forecasting (Growth curves, risk alerts)
Everything should feel alive — think motion design meets finance UI. It’s Baremetrics, reimagined for the AI-native, visually obsessed generation.

1/ 

I got a fully working Netflix-style feed with real-time video previews, search, login, and dynamic carousels.

All from this one prompt:

"Build a responsive Netflix clone with real video playback (with sound), full branding, working UI, search, login, and dynamic carousels using modern frameworks.

---

2/

It gave me a working UI, timeline, drag-and-drop editing, export features, and even login credentials.

Got a few errors, but fixed everything with a single follow-up prompt.

Here is a prompt I used:

"Build a fully responsive and feature-complete CapCut replica with timeline editing, drag-and-drop clips, effects, audio, text, and export, matching CapCut’s exact UI, UX, and performance."

It picked the name, wrote a viral headline, added testimonials, and even built a working lead gen form.

Here is the prompt:

"Create a fully functional and stunning website for an Agency."

4/ 

I gave it this one prompt:

“Create a multiplayer web game where users take turns refining an AI prompt word-by-word, triggering a live output after each turn, with real-time reactions, win tracking, and funny prompt history.”

It actually built it—fully functional and playable.
